Description:

The Face Authentication System is a web-based application designed to provide robust authentication using advanced facial recognition algorithms. It ensures secure access control to sensitive systems and applications, enhancing security measures and user authentication experiences. Users can effortlessly sign in using their Google account, benefiting from OAuth 2.0 authorization. Upon successful registration or initial sign-in, users receive a welcome message via email, enriching their onboarding experience.

List of Application Features:

• User Registration: Users can register using their Google account, enabling quick access to the system.
• Face Recognition: Advanced facial recognition algorithms authenticate users securely.
• User Profile Management: Users can manage their profiles, update information, and modify settings.
• Access Control: Role-based access control ensures appropriate permissions for different user roles.
• Email Notifications: Automatic email notifications provide updates, alerts, and welcome messages.
• Security Measures: Implementation of robust security measures safeguards user data and system integrity.
• Session Management: Efficient session management ensures secure and seamless user experiences.
• Dashboard: Interactive dashboards provide insights and analytics for administrators.
• Audit Trail: Comprehensive audit trails track user activities for accountability and security purposes.
• Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms enhance system reliability and user experience.
• Logging: Detailed logging functionalities provide visibility into system events and activities.
• Integration with Azure: Seamless integration with Azure ensures reliable deployment and scalability.
